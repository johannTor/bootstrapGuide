# html/css - bootstrap

Live version: http://zany-salt.surge.sh/

This guide was about getting familiar with UI frameworks and more specificially learn how to use bootstrap.
I decided to make the webpage about a fictional tour agency that offers sightseeing flights over Iceland. It was definitely hard for me to 
get into using this framework since there are so many classes you can use and many ways that you can use them. Like I tried using a button
element for the 'check prices' button but I couldn't make it navigate to the booking page. So I found out that you can use the a tag and make it look like the button by adding the desired classes to it.
I also like how I didn't have to write any media queries to scale it for different screen sizes.

It took me quite a while to get this 2 page site created though but I can definitely see the advantages of using a front end framework especially once you get more used to them.
